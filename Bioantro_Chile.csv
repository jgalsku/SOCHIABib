Due to different historical and administrative processes that have affected the institution, the conservation and management of these collections have suffered. This situation triggered the initiative of two projects of the Fundación Andes (C-23603 and C-23922-25 ) for the valorization and management of collections as a solution to the problem. The proposals were formulated and developed by a multidisciplinary team of physical archaeology and anthropology professionals of the abovementioned university, as well as professionals from the National Center for Conservation and Restoration (CNCR) and the Center of Heritage Documentation (CDBP), both branches of the Department of Libraries, Archives and Museums (DIBAM). The article hereunder describes the processes that were carried out for the conservation and valorization of bioanthropological material, with special emphasis on methodologies and technical aspects. The experience of the aforementioned projects exemplifies the role different public institutions such as our university can play which, as depositaries of heritage pieces, have the mission to valorize this material for its study and dissemination.","2008","2018-02-14 07:30:28","2021-08-10 04:22:20","","69-96","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sin región;Manejo de cuerpos humanos","","","","bioanthropology; collection's management; conservation; physical anthropology; University of Chile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first one gave rise to Amerindians (Paleo-Indians), the second and third ones to Nadene and Aleut-Eskimo, respectively. Variation in mtDNA has been used to infer the demographic structure of the Amerindian ancestors. The study of RFLP all along the mtDNA and the analysis of nucleotide substitutions in the D-loop region of the mitochondrial genome apparently indicate that most or all full-blooded Amerindians cluster in one of four different mitochondrial haplotypes that are considered to represent the founder maternal lineages of Paleo-Indians. We have studied the mtDNA diversity in 109 Amerindians belonging to 3 different tribes, and we have reanalyzed the published data on 482 individuals from 18 other tribes. Our study confirms the existence of four major Amerindian haplotypes. However, we also found evidence supporting the existence of several other potential founder haplotypes or haplotype subsets in addition to the four ancestral lineages reported. Confirmation of a relatively high number of founder haplotypes would indicate that early migration into America was not accompanied by a severe genetic bottleneck.","1994-07","2018-02-14 07:33:45","2021-04-13 02:52:34","","27-33","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sur,Norte Grande;Genética","","","","Amerindian; founder mitochondrial haplotypes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we consider the role of sociocultural beliefs concerning sickness in the construction of individuals’ social identities in the pre-Columbian Andes. Paleopathological analyses reveal evidence of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, a facially disﬁguring infectious disease endemic to tropical lowland rainforests, in the skeletal remains of six females buried at Coyo Oriental and Tchecar Túmulo Sur, two Middle Horizon (AD 500–1000) cemeteries in the highland desert of San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. We use pre-Columbian Andean sickness ideology reconstructed from ethnography and ethnohistory as an interpretative framework for data from these individuals’ mortuary contexts and isotopic analyses used to infer residential mobility. Our study demonstrates that consideration of sickness ideology in conjunction with multiple lines of bioarchaeological and archaeological evidence increases understanding of the social experience of disease at San Pedro during the Middle Horizon.","2011-03","2018-10-14 20:37:22","2021-04-13 03:21:07","2018-10-14 20:37:22","24-34","","1","1","","","Pre-Columbian Andean sickness ideology and the social experience of leishmaniasis","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\J7TA7PN8\Marsteller et al. - 2011 - Pre-Columbian Andean sickness ideology and the soc.pdf","","mobility; mortuary archaeology; mucocutaneous leishmaniasis; radiogenic strontium isotopes; social identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Atacameño people experienced the highest degree of social and cultural changes between 400 and 900 AD when they were assimilated into the Tiwanaku trade and political web that influenced most of the Central-Southern Andes. Under the influence of Tiwanaku, San Pedro de Atacama experienced its greatest economic development. Prior analyses of local human skeletal remains have shown a significant increase in the stature of the local population during the same period. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the Tiwanaku influence on the local epidemiological profile using the incidence of periostitis and osteomyelitis as indicators of biological stress. Surprisingly, the best epidemiological condition occurred during the final phase of influence of Tiwanaku (910-960 AD), and not during the apex influence (480-920 AD), as expected by the archaeological context. We suggest that population growth and aggregation may have counteracted the benefits of improved nutrition during the peak Tiwanaku influence. A severe drought occurred between 1,100 and 1,400 AD in Northern Chile. This could also explain the marked increase of bone infections in the post-Tiwanaku period (920-1,240 AD).","2011-06","2018-11-08 03:44:26","2021-08-13 04:25:30","2018-11-08 03:44:26","135-146","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\XCLJJ2NJ\Tótora da-Gloria et al. - 2011 - NONSPECIFIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN PREHISTORIC SAN.pdf","","bioarchaeology; epidemiology; Tiwanaku; Atacama Desert; biological quality of life","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sus conjuntos tecnológicos y arqueofaunísticos señalan una dependencia de recursos del medio litoral y marítimo. La información de isótopos estables del carbono y nitrógeno en restos humanos asociados a estos contextos provee una herramienta de análisis independiente para evaluar las interpretaciones realizadas sobre la base de otros conjuntos de datos arqueológicos. Este trabajo presenta los resultados de análisis de δ               13               C y δ               15               N de 38 individuos con edades en el rango entre 2300 y 200 cal aP (fechamientos directos               14               C por AMS), así como de muestras complementarias de arqueofauna.

The data from the technological and archaeofaunal collections indicate dependence on littoral and marine resources. The information from carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of human remains associated with these contexts provides a powerful and an independent analytical tool, enabling us to evaluate the subsistence models based on other archaeological datasets. In this paper, we present the results of δ               13               C and δ               15               N analyses of 38 individuals with direct               14               C AMS ages between 2300 and 200 cal BP, as well as that of archaeofaunal samples from the region. The analysis of isotopic values supports the interpretation of a subsistence pattern focused mainly on littoral and marine resources. We then compare the δ               13               C and δ               15               N values to those of other canoeist hunter-gatherers of the central and southern channels of Patagonia, highlighting the differences in subsistence trajectories between the regions involved.","2019-09","2021-02-11 19:31:46","2021-05-16 03:37:13","2021-02-11 19:31:46","550-568","","03","30","","Latin Am. antiq.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Sur,Extremo Sur;Bioarqueología,Isótopos","","","","cazadores recolectores marinos; holoceno tardío; isótopos estables; canales occidentales de Patagonia; dieta; subsistencia; Archipiélago de los Chonos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

La muestra estuvo compuesta por colecciones prehispánicas del norte de Chile (Pica 8 y cementerios A, B, C, D, y H de Pisagua) y subactuales (Cementerio General, Santiago) el cual fue utilizado como grupo control (sexo conocido, sin DCI). De las vistas fotográficas frontal (N= 131) y lateral (N= 127) de cada cráneo se obtuvieron matrices de hitos anatómicos homólogos, que se emplearon para estimar por análisis de Procrustes el tamaño del centroide y los componentes uniforme y no uniforme de la forma. La inspección visual del patrón de deformación calvaria se realizó sobre grillas cartesianas derivadas del análisis de deformación relativa. Los resultados del análisis intrapoblacional en vista frontal mostraron diferencias significativas debidas al sexo, y en el caso de la Población de Pisagua, a la interacción de esta variable con el efecto de la D.C.I. El mapa de homologías utilizado en vista lateral no dio cuenta del dimorfismo sexual en ninguna de las poblaciones analizadas. Las principales diferencias morfológicas explicadas por el dimorfismo sexual se ubican en la vista frontal, (expansión-contracción transversal de la cara, expansióncontracción de la escama frontal y expansión-contracción vertical de la región facial). La D.C.I. afectó significativamente las expansiones y contracciones en sentido transversal, así como las contracciones y expansiones de la escama frontal en sentido cráneo-caudal. En vista frontal las diferencias en el tamaño del centroide no resultaron significativas, a excepción de Pisagua, probablemente debido a la interacción de la variable escalar con el efecto D.C.I. En vista lateral el tamaño del centroide discriminó significativamente a las poblaciones en estudio. A nivel interpoblacional las vistas frontales se agruparon por origen étnico. Estos resultados permiten concluir que no hay efecto de la D.C.I. sobre el D.S., ni está siendo explicado por diferencias de tamaño en vista frontal, en tanto que en vista lateral, este último factor sí está afectando el patrón de variación de la forma. En conclusión, la técnica de la morfometría geométrica logra capturar eficazmente estas variaciones morfológicas debidas al D.S., que resultan independientes de la D.C.I. en vista frontal","2004","2021-03-28 03:47:18","2021-05-16 14:58:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","Memoria para optar al Título de Antropólogo Físico.

However, the adjust-ment of this method in target populations has proven necessary to achieve maximum accuracy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate three different methods of age estimation based on root transparency in a Chilean population sample constituted of 92 individuals (46 males and 46 females). Mean errors of estimation of the three methods show notable variation compared with documented age, particularly in the oldest individuals. The methods that obtained the most accurate results were the Prince and Ubelaker (2002) method for white males and the Lamendin et al. (1992) method for both sexes. These results suggest the need of creating specific formulas for the Chilean population in order to obtain more accurate estimations. indi-viduos (46 hombres y 46 mujeres). Los errores medios de la estimación de los tres métodos muestran una notable variación comparados con la edad documentada, particularmente en los individuos más ancianos.

Archaeological evidence indicates the presence of humans as far as southern Chile by 14.6 thousand years ago (ka), shortly after the Pleistocene ice sheets blocking access from eastern Beringia began to retreat. Genetic estimates of the timing and route of entry have been constrained by the lack of suitable calibration points and low genetic diversity of Native Americans. We sequenced 92 whole mitochondrial genomes from pre-Columbian South American skeletons dating from 8.6 to 0.5 ka, allowing a detailed, temporally calibrated reconstruction of the peopling of the Americas in a Bayesian coalescent analysis. The data suggest that a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16.0 ka, following previous isolation in eastern Beringia for ~2.4 to 9 thousand years after separation from eastern Siberian populations. Following a rapid movement throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a marked phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted through time. All of the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages.","2016","2021-03-30 17:54:35","2021-08-10 04:11:19","","e1501385","","4","2","","Sci Adv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","Sin región;Genética","","; ","https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/2/4/e1501385.full.pdf; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27051878","population genetics; North America; ancient DNA; phylogeny; genetic variation; mitochondrial DNA; haplotypes; Bayes theorem; emigration and immigration","South America; Beringia; colonization; Native America","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a previous communication, we were able to show, by means of a distance analysis, that a craniofacial differentiation accompanied the process of cultural evolution in the valleys (Rothhammer and Santoro [2001] Lat. Am. Antiq. 12:59-66). Recently, numerous South Amerindian mtDNA studies were published, and more accurate molecular techniques to study ancient mtDNA are available. In view of these recent developments, we decided 1) to study chronological changes of ancient mtDNA haplogroup frequencies in the nearby Lluta, Azapa, and Camarones Valleys, 2) to identify microevolutionary forces responsible for such changes, and 3) to compare ancient mtDNA haplogroup frequencies with previous data in order to validate craniometrical results and to reconstruct the biological history of the prehistoric valley groups in the context of their interaction with culturally more developed highland populations. From a total of 97 samples from 83 individuals, 68 samples (61 individuals) yielded amplifications for the fragments that harbor classical mtDNA markers. The haplogroup distribution among the total sample was as follows: 26.2%, haplogroup A; 34.4%, haplogroup B; 14.8%, haplogroup C; 3.3%, haplogroup D; and 21.3%, other haplogroups. Haplogroup B tended to increase, and haplogroup A to decrease during a 3,900-year time interval. The sequence data are congruent with the haplogroup analysis. In fact, the sequencing of hypervariable region I of 30 prehistoric individuals revealed 43 polymorphic sites. Sequence alignment and subsequent phylogenetic tree construction showed two major clusters associated with the most common restriction haplogroups. Individuals belonging to haplogroups C and D tended to cluster together with nonclassical lineages.","2005-06","2018-02-14 07:33:38","2021-08-10 04:11:01","","170-181","","2","127","","Am J Phys Anthropol","Microevolution in prehistoric Andean populations","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","Norte Grande;Genética","","; ","https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.10438; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15503344","ancient mtDNA; population genetics; cambio cultural; ADNmt antiguo; geography; cultural change; highland migration; microevolution; cultural evolution; genetic variation; mitochondrial DNA; gene frequency; molecular evolution; haplotypes; DNA sequence analysis; cephalometry; cluster analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report genome-wide data from 20 ancient individuals, and co-analyze it with previously reported data. We reveal that immigration does not explain the appearance of marine adaptations in South Patagonia. We describe partial genetic continuity since ~6600 BP and two later gene flows correlated with technological changes: one between 4700–2000 BP that affected primarily marine-based groups, and a later one impacting all <2000 BP groups.

Methodology We discovered morphologic and molecular evidence of ancient infections in 4 female skulls in the archaeological cemetery of Coyo Oriente, in the desert of San Pedro de Atacama, Northern Chile. The boney facial lesions visible in the skulls could have been caused by a number of chronic infections including chronic Leishmaniasis. This diagnosis was confirmed using PCR-sequenced analyses of bone fragments from the skulls of the affected individuals.Leishmaniasis is not normally found in the high-altitude desert of Northern Chile; where the harsh climate does not allow the parasite to complete its life cycle. The presence of Leishmaniasis in ancient skulls from the region implies infection by the protozoan in an endemic area–likely, in our subjects, to have been the lowlands of North-Eastern Argentina or in Southern Bolivia. Conclusions We propose that the presence of the disease in ancient times in the high altitude desert of San Pedro de Atacama is the result of an exogamic system of patrilocal marriages, where women from different cultures followed their husbands to their ancestral homes, allowing immigrant women, infected early in life, to be incorporated in the Atacama desert society before they became disfigured by the disease. The present globalization of goods and services and the extraordinary facile movement of people across borders and continents have lead to a resurgence of infectious diseases and re-emergence of infections such as Leishmaniasis. We show here that such factors were already present millennia ago, shaping demographic trends and the epidemiology of infections just as they do today.","2009","2018-10-21 05:11:45","2021-08-13 04:26:09","2021-03-30 15:58:37","e6983","","9","4","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Norte Grande;Genética,Bioarqueología","","","","Chile; ancient DNA; face; deserts; skull","Leishmania; Leishmania donovani; Leishmaniasis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Ata specimen carried a strange phenotype-6-in stature, fewer than expected ribs, elongated cranium, and accelerated bone age-leading to speculation that this was a preserved nonhuman primate, human fetus harboring genetic mutations, or even an extraterrestrial. We previously reported that it was human by DNA analysis with an estimated bone age of about 6-8 yr at the time of demise. To determine the possible genetic drivers of the observed morphology, DNA from the specimen was subjected to whole-genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform with an average 11.5× coverage of 101-bp, paired-end reads. In total, 3,356,569 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were found as compared to the human reference genome, 518,365 insertions and deletions (indels), and 1047 structural variations (SVs) were detected. Here, we present the detailed whole-genome analysis showing that Ata is a female of human origin, likely of Chilean descent, and its genome harbors mutations in genes (COL1A1, COL2A1, KMT2D, FLNB, ATR, TRIP11, PCNT) previously linked with diseases of small stature, rib anomalies, cranial malformations, premature joint fusion, and osteochondrodysplasia (also known as skeletal dysplasia).

Exploring the genomic diversity within Patagonia is not just a valuable strategy to gain a better understanding of the history and diversification of human populations in the southernmost tip of the Americas, but it would also improve the representation of Native American diversity in global databases of human variation. Here, we present genome data from four modern populations from Central Southern Chile and Patagonia (n = 61) and four ancient maritime individuals from Patagonia (∼1,000 y old). Both the modern and ancient individuals studied in this work have a greater genetic affinity with other modern Native Americans than to any non-American population, showing within South America a clear structure between major geographical regions. Native Patagonian Kawéskar and Yámana showed the highest genetic affinity with the ancient individuals, indicating genetic continuity in the region during the past 1,000 y before present, together with an important agreement between the ethnic affiliation and historical distribution of both groups. Lastly, the ancient maritime individuals were genetically equidistant to a ∼200-y-old terrestrial hunter-gatherer from Tierra del Fuego, which supports a model with an initial separation of a common ancestral group to both maritime populations from a terrestrial population, with a later diversification of the maritime groups.","2018-04-24","2018-04-20 02:24:16","2021-03-30 18:10:17","2021-03-30 17:33:40","E4006-E4012","","17","115","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 . http://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","Sur,Extremo Sur;Genética","","; ; ; C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\29QLR5DX\1715688115.html; ","https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/17/E4006.full.pdf; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632188; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632188; https://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4006","","maritime hunter-gatherers; paleogenomics; Patagonia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different sources of evidence have contributed to the characterization of the local populations, but some main questions about their history remain unsolved. Among the native populations, two marine hunter-gatherers groups inhabited the Patagonian channels below the 478S: Kawéskar and Yámana. Regardless of their geographical proximity and cultural resemblance, their languages were mutually unintelligible. In this study we aim to evaluate the genetic diversity of uniparental genetic markers in both groups and to test if there is a high genetic differentiation between them, mirroring their linguistic differences. Material and Methods Ancient DNA was extracted from 37 samples from both populations. We compared their genetic variability of their mitochondrial lineages and Y-STR as well as with other modern native populations from the area and further north. Results and Discussion We observed an important differentiation in their maternal lineages: while Kawéskar shows a high frequency of D (80%), Yámana shows a high frequency of C (90%). The analysis of paternal lineages reveals the presence of only Q1a2a1a1 and little variation was found between individuals. Both groups show very low levels of genetic diversity compared with modern populations. We also notice shared and unique mitochondrial DNA variants between modern and ancient samples of Kawéskar and Yámana.

But many details such as the timing, route(s), and origin of the first settlers remain uncertain. In the last decade genetic evidence has taken on a major role in elucidating the peopling of the Americas. To study the early peopling of South America, we sequenced the control region of mitochondrial DNA from 300 individuals belonging to indigenous populations of Chile and Argentina, and also obtained seven complete mitochondrial DNA sequences. We identified two novel mtDNA monophyletic clades, preliminarily designated B2l and C1b13, which together with the recently described D1g sub-haplogroup have locally high frequencies and are basically restricted to populations from the extreme south of South America. The estimated ages of D1g and B2l, about ∼15,000 years BP, together with their similar population dynamics and the high haplotype diversity shown by the networks, suggests that they probably appeared soon after the arrival of the first settlers and agrees with the dating of the earliest archaeological sites in South America (Monte Verde, Chile, 14,500 BP). One further sub-haplogroup, D4h3a5, appears to be restricted to Fuegian-Patagonian populations and reinforces our hypothesis of the continuity of the current Patagonian populations with the initial founders. Our results indicate that the extant native populations inhabiting South Chile and Argentina are a group which had a common origin, and suggest a population break between the extreme south of South America and the more northern part of the continent. Thus the early colonization process was not just an expansion from north to south, but also included movements across the Andes.","2012-09-10","2018-02-14 07:34:32","2021-04-13 03:00:45","2021-03-30 17:36:44","","","9","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","Sur,Extremo Sur;Genética","","; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438176/pdf/pone.0043486.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438176/","mtDNA; South America; early peopling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ages and geographic distributions of these clades could provide novel clues on the colonization processes of the different regions of the double continent. As for the Southern Cone of South America, this approach has recently allowed the identification of two local clades (D1g and D1j) whose age estimates agree with the dating of the earliest archaeological sites in South America, indicating that Paleo-Indians might have reached that region from Beringia in less than 2000 years. In this study, we sequenced 46 mitogenomes belonging to two additional clades, termed B2i2 (former B2l) and C1b13, which were recently identified on the basis of mtDNA control-region data and whose geographical distributions appear to be restricted to Chile and Argentina. We confirm that their mutational motifs most likely arose in the Southern Cone region. However, the age estimate for B2i2 and C1b13 (11-13,000 years) appears to be younger than those of other local clades. The difference could reflect the different evolutionary origins of the distinct South American-specific sub-haplogroups, with some being already present, at different times and locations, at the very front of the expansion wave in South America, and others originating later in situ, when the tribalization process had already begun. A delayed origin of a few thousand years in one of the locally derived populations, possibly in the central part of Chile, would have limited the geographical and ethnic diffusion of B2i2 and explain the present-day occurrence that appears to be mainly confined to the Tehuelche and Araucanian-speaking groups.","2012","2018-02-14 07:32:54","2021-04-13 03:43:21","","e51311","","12","7","","PLoS One","Arrival of Paleo-Indians to the southern cone of South America","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","Sin región;Genética","","; ","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051311&type=printable; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23240014","North America; phylogeny; mitochondrial DNA; molecular evolution; haplotypes","South America","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there is considerable regional variation, two large-scale “waves” of escalated conflict that are clearly supported by the cranial trauma and settlement pattern data occurred in the Final Formative (late Early Horizon, 400 BC–AD 100) and the Late Intermediate period (AD 1000–1400).","2013-12-01","2021-04-02 19:04:49","2021-04-13 02:51:28","","307-369","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10814-013-9065-1","trauma; warfare; Andes; patterns; settlement; skeletal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social structures that encouraged the maintenance of separate identities among coexistent ethnic groups may explain this apparent contradiction. Although the early expansion of the Tiwanaku state (A.D. 600-1000) is often interpreted according to a centralized model derived from Old World precedents, recent archaeological research suggests a reappraisal of the socio-political organization of Tiwanaku civilization, both for the diversity of social entities within its core region and for the multiple agencies behind its wider program of agropastoral colonization. Tiwanaku's sociopolitical pluralism in both its homeland and colonies tempers some of archaeology's global assumptions about the predominant role of centralized institutions in archaic states.","2015-07-28","2021-04-02 19:04:58","2021-04-13 03:10:04","","9202-9","","30","112","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\NWKYNPDB\Goldstein - 2015 - Multiethnicity, pluralism, and migration in the so.pdf","","archaeology; South America; religion; bones; ethnic Groups; human migration; politics; social change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assembled genome-wide data on 89 individuals dating from ∼9,000-500 years ago (BP), with a particular focus on the period of the rise and fall of state societies. Today’s genetic structure began to develop by 5,800 BP, followed by bi-directional gene flow between the North and South Highlands, and between the Highlands and Coast. We detect minimal admixture among neighboring groups between ∼2,000–500 BP, although we do detect cosmopolitanism (people of diverse ancestries living side-by-side) in the heartlands of the Tiwanaku and Inca polities. We also highlight cases of long-range mobility connecting the Andes to Argentina and the Northwest Andes to the Amazon Basin.

Sus restos, actualmente conservados en el Museo Nacional de Historia Natural (Santiago Chile), fueron exhumados por Max Uhle en 1913 en cuatro cementerios correspondientes a tres etapas del desarrollo agroalfarero del Norte de Chile (Formativo, Tiwanaku y Desarrollo Regional). El objetivo del presente trabajo es el estudio de la estructura de la población a partir del análisis de la distribución de rasgos fenotípicos. Bajo el supuesto de distribución al azar de efectos no genéticos, dicha estructura refleja cambios genéticos que dependen de la acción de factores microevolutivos asociados con eventos históricos producidos a nivel regional y local. Se relevó un conjunto de rasgos morfológicos (atributos y variables continuas) en un total de 120 individuos y se analizó la distribución de estos rasgos de acuerdo con el sexo, la edad, la deformación artificial y el cementerio de origen, aplicando técnicas de análisis estadístico uni y multivariadas. Esta información es completada con observaciones sobre la incidencia de algunas patologías, el estado de la dentición y las características del perfil demográfico. Se establecen sus relaciones biológicas con otros grupos próximos del Norte de Chile y se realizan inferencias sobre el origen probable de la población local. On the northern coast of Chile and near of what is today the city of Pisagua, a group of prehistoric fishermen lived from 300 AC to 1450 DC. Their remains, now preserved at the National Museum of Natural History, were exhumed by Max Uhle in 1913 in four burial sites corresponding to three stages of the agriculturist development of Northern Chile. The aim of the present work is the study of the population structure from the analysis of the phenotypic traits distribution. On the assumption of random distribution of non genetic effects, such structure reflects genetic changes which depend on the activity of microevolutionary factors associated with historical events which took place at a local and regional level. The achievement of the aims required the acquisition of the set of morphological traits (attributes and continuous variables) in 120 individuals. The study of the local biology was carried out through the analysis of the distribution of such features in relations to sex, age, artificial deformation and source cemetery. Uni and multivariate techniques were applied. This was completed with observation on the incidence of certain pathologies and dentition state, and characteristics of the demographic profile. Its biological relations with other nearly groups in northern Chile are established, and inferences are realized about local population origin.","1999","2021-04-03 00:23:02","2021-08-10 18:06:53","2021-04-03 00:23:02","207-235","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología,Morfometría","","","","Pisagua","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

La muestra empleada está constituida por 143 individuos correspondientes a dos series arcaicas (Morro-Uhle y Morro 1-1 /6) y una formativa (Playa Miller-7 o Plm-7). Se trabajó con un total de 29 variables métricas del cráneo. La variabilidad biológica se evaluó mediante el análisis discriminante y la estimación de distancias D'. Las relaciones de parentesco se infirieron a partir de las diferencias entre las varianzas dentro de grupos y del cálculo de la divergencia promedio de cada subpoblación con respecto a la población total. La estructura de la población fue inferida a partir de un método basado en la teoría de genética cuantitativa que predice una relación lineal entre la varianza fenotípica media dentro de grupo y su distancia a la media poblacional (centroide). Se comprobó que las tres muestras estudiadas son diferentes desde punto de vista morfológico. La mayor distancia se observó entre Morro-Uhle y Plm-7, la menor entre Morro-Uhle y Morro 1-1 /6, presentando la distancia entre Morro 1-1 /6 y Plm-7 un valor intermedio. Con respecto a la población total el grupo más divergente fue Plm-7 y el menos divergente Morro 1-1/6. Se demuestra que este último, ubicado en una posición intermedia entre Morro-Uh le y Plm-7, comparte el acervo génico de ambos y constituye el ancestro más probable del grupo inhumado en Plm- 7. Esto constituye una prueba relevante de la participación de los pescadores arcaicos en la integración de la población formativa de la costa Norte de Chile, explicación que no descarta el aporte genético de otras regiones del Área Andina Centro Meridional.","2004","2021-04-04 00:50:26","2021-08-13 04:27:15","","149-160","","","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","pescadores; Arica; período Arcaico Tardío y Formativo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is based on the interdisciplinary study of human remains from archaeological cemeteries in the Andean Uspallata Valley (Argentina), located in the southern frontier of the Inka Empire. The studied samples span AD 800–1500, encompassing the highly dynamic Late Intermediate Period and culminating with the imperial expansion. Our research combines a macro-regional study of human paleomobility and migration based on a new strontium isoscape across the Andes that allows identifying locals and migrants, a geometric morphometric analysis of cranio-facial morphology suggesting separate ancestral lineages, and a paleodietary reconstruction based on stable isotopes showing that the migrants had diets exceptionally high in C               4               plants and largely based on maize agriculture. Significantly, this migration influx occurred during a period of regional demographic increase and would have been part of a widespread period of change in settlement patterns and population movements that preceded the Inka expansion. These processes increased local social diversity and may have been subsequently utilized by the Inka to channel interaction with the local societies.","2020-12","2021-04-04 01:25:19","2021-05-16 15:02:14","2021-04-04 01:25:19","21171","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Centro;Bioarqueología,Isótopos,Morfometría","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\759SSJE5\Barberena et al. - 2020 - Multi-isotopic and morphometric evidence for the m.pdf","","stable isotopes; morphometric; Inka","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present an archeological discovery and meta-analysis that challenge the man-the-hunter hypothesis. Excavations at the Andean highland site of Wilamaya Patjxa reveal a 9000-year-old human burial (WMP6) associated with a hunting toolkit of stone projectile points and animal processing tools. Osteological, proteomic, and isotopic analyses indicate that this early hunter was a young adult female who subsisted on terrestrial plants and animals. Analysis of Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene burial practices throughout the Americas situate WMP6 as the earliest and most secure hunter burial in a sample that includes 10 other females in statistical parity with early male hunter burials. The findings are consistent with nongendered labor practices in which early hunter-gatherer females were big-game hunters.","2020-11","2021-04-02 19:04:58","2021-05-16 03:41:09","2021-04-04 01:38:42","eabd0310","","45","6","","Sci.

Para conseguirlo, se alteraban diversos factores ambientales de modelación craneana mediante la instalación de distintos aparatos alrededor de la cabeza durante los primeros años de vida, de manera combinada o por separado, que al ser aplicados con distinta intensidad sobre los huesos de la bóveda, eran capaces de conseguir formas craneofaciales diferentes a las normales. Las poblaciones del Norte Grande de Chile no estuvieron exentas de la práctica de la Deformación Intencional de Cráneo. En el Complejo Pica-Tarapacá, así como en otras zonas del Norte de Chile, se han encontrado restos humanos con claros signos de alteración deliberada de la forma del cráneo, evidenciables en las osamentas excavadas del Cementerio Pica 8. El presente estudio tuvo por objetivo estudiar las características estructurales de 26 cráneos deformados intencionalmente y 12 no deformados de una misma muestra arqueológica y 11 cráneos de una muestra actual, midiendo el espesor y volumen óseo de las bóvedas craneanas a través la reconstrucción tridimensional de Tomografías Computarizadas, obteniendo valores continuos y una representación gráfica de la distribución del espesor óseo derivada del mapeo de la estructura estudiada, poniendo a prueba la hipótesis planteada que no existen diferencias en las variables analizadas entre los tres grupos de sujetos. Los resultados obtenidos confirmaron parcialmente la hipótesis planteada ya que no existieron diferencias significativas en cuanto al espesor óseo pero sí en cuanto al volumen. Estos resultados son acaso atribuibles al mayor tamaño de los cráneos de los individuos actuales respecto a los individuos arqueológicos que a la deformación intencional de cráneo misma.","2014","2021-04-04 01:56:25","2021-04-13 02:59:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","Trabajo de Investigación Requisito para optar al Título de Cirujano Dentista, Universidad de Chile","Santiago, Chile","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Osteología,Bioarqueología","","","","deformación craneana; Pica-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the perspective of human geography, this mountain range provides ready access to highly diverse altitudinally arranged ecosystems. The combination of a geologically and ecologically diverse landscape provides an exceptional context to explore the potential of strontium isotopes to track the movements of people and the conveyance of material culture. Here we develop an isotopic landscape of bioavailable strontium (87Sr/86Sr) that is applied to reconstruct human paleogeography across time in the southern Andes of Argentina and Chile (31º-34ºS). These results come from a macro-regional sampling of rodents (N= 65) and plants (N= 26) from modern and archaeological contexts. This ‘Southern Andean Strontium Transect’ extends over 350 km across the Andes, encompassing the main geological provinces between the Pacific coast (Chile) and the eastern lowlands (Argentina). We follow a recently developed approach to isoscape construction based on Random Forest regression and GIS analysis. Our results suggest that bioavailable strontium is tightly linked with bedrock geology and offers a highly resolved proxy to track human paleogeography involving the levels of territories or daily mobility and anomalous events that disrupt home ranges, such as migration. The southern Andes provide an ideal geological setting to develop this approach, since the geological variation in rock age and composition produces distinctive isotopic signatures for each main biogeographical region. Finally, we apply this framework to a set of results from human remains from the Uspallata Valley in Mendoza (Argentina), to assess the incidence of migration in the key period of the consolidation of agropastoral economies between AD 800-1400. The application of the isoscape to the values from human remains confirms the persistence of human groups with relatively restricted territories encompassing Uspallata and the adjacent Precordillera between AD 800-1500. We also identify a pulse of human migration between AD 1280-1420, shortly preceding the Inka conquest. Looking forward, we expect to converge with ongoing efforts in South America to build a continental research framework to track the movement of people, animals, and artefacts across space and time.","2021","2021-04-04 14:51:15","2021-05-16 03:35:58","2021-04-04 14:51:15","","","","9","","Front.

The asymmetry of the appendicular skeleton of the modern adult Chilean population was investigated in its morphological aspect, using both traditional anthropometry and geometric morphometrics. The sample was selected from the Colección Subactual de Santiago, housed in the University of Chile, Santiago, Chile, with N= 131 (69 males and 62 females). The traditional metric analysis of size and the geometric morphometric analysis of shape showed that there was a significant difference between sides in both sexes with a strong component of directional asymmetry. Mean metrics and ranges of asymmetry were established, contributing to the characterization of this population. A method to pair match elements from commingled settings, which is a combination of metric ranges of asymmetry and principal component analysis of shape variables, was created resulting in 95% accuracy when pair matching the humerus, radius, femur and tibia. This constitutes an important contribution to the analysis of shape in forensic contexts due to its strong mathematical component, objectivity and repeatability.","2013","2021-04-04 20:34:46","2021-05-16 15:02:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","Thesis Submitted in Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Teesside University","Teesside University","","","","","","","","Sin región,Centro;Forense,Osteología,Morfometría","","","","forensic anthropology; bilateral asymmetry; appendicular skeleton","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this chapter, we present and explore socio-historical landmarks that have given rise to the origin and development of bioarchaeological research in Chile. Furthermore, we discuss the controversies concerning the study of human remains and point out the new directions currently being developed within the field of bioarchaeology across the country.We conclude that after a century of research involving human remains in Chile, academic and methodological approaches have undergone important developments in the context of the 20th century's national project, contemporary research streams, and the acknowledgement of multiculturalism. It is mostly during the last three decades that the field of bioarchaeology has expanded and diversified, as consequence of its professionalization and an expansion of the contract archaeology sector. However, whilst methodological developments have made great strides in different areas of bioarchaeological research, theoretical developments have been comparatively slower and have not yet shown an explicit and critical stance according to contemporary social circumstances.","2018","2021-04-05 02:04:15","2021-04-13 03:30:45","2021-04-05 02:04:15","7-24","","","","","","Bioarchaeology in Chile","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-89984-8_2","","","","Springer Link","","Sin región;Bioarqueología","","","","bioarchaeology; history; contract archaeology; multiculturalism; national project","Chile","O'Donnabhain, Barra; Lozada, Maria Cecilia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a study of the funerary contexts of the Ceramic Periods in central Chile in order to assess whether in this scenario, generally considered very significant in the low-scale societies studied here, gender categories were constructed or signified, and how this changed over time. The results of the analysis suggest that gender categorization was not always important in this scenario. Among Llolleo groups, the offerings associated with females and children suggest their relation with production spheres; in Bato groups, on the other hand, age categories seem to be more important. In the Late Intermediate Period, it is the collective aspect that appears to be stressed in the funerary contexts.","2020-08","2021-04-02 19:05:16","2021-04-06 01:13:38","2021-04-06 00:33:22","367-388","","3","30","","CAJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Centro;Bioarqueología","","","https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/gender-and-age-in-funerary-practices-in-the-ceramic-periods-in-central-chile/87ECDEA83393CC442C90B4B8503061F7","Central Chile; gender; age; ceramic periods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

La muestra está representada por 326 individuos provenientes de diferentes sitios o sectores del yacimiento. Para evaluar las diferencias fenotípicas entre períodos se emplearon 37 caracteres métricos del cráneo y un conjunto de procedimientos de análisis estadístico uni y multivariado. En el marco de la teoría genética de los caracteres cuantitativos se espera que el parentesco de cada período junto con la varianza fenotípica, fluctúen de acuerdo con el tamaño efectivo y el aporte migratorio desde regiones próximas y más o menos distantes. En efecto, el parentesco promedio estimado para este ayllu (FST) fue de .03, siendo mayor en mujeres que en hombres. En general, de acuerdo con este valor es posible inferir que los habitantes de Quitor vivieron en una condición de mayor aislamiento que los grupos agroalfareros asentados en el Valle de Azapa (F               ST               = .013). Además en el período Medio (Tiwanaku) se produjo un incremento moderado de la varianza fenotípica producida probablemente por un exceso de flujo gènico proveniente de regiones próximas.                        ,              Abstract                            We study the temporal differentiation and genetic divergence between the Formative (300 B.C.–A.D. 400), Tiwanaku (A.D. 400–1000), and Regional Development (A.D. 1000–1470) periods of the group buried in the Quitor ayllu of San Pedro de Atacama (north Chile). Our aim is to determine if biological changes existed, associated with the periods or phases of cultural development in the region. The sample consists of 326 individuals from different sites or sectors of the site. In order to evaluate the phenotypic differences between periods we employed 37 metric characteristics of the skull and a group of uni-and multivariate statistical procedures. According to genetic theory concerning quantitative characteristics it is expected that the kinship of each period, along with phenotypic variation, fluctuates in accordance with the effective size and migratory influx from regions nearby and more or less distant. The average kinship calculated for this ayllu (FST) was 0.03, being greater in women than in men. This result indicates that the prehistoric population of Quitor lived in greater isolation than the agricultural pastoral groups in the Azapa Valley (F               ST               = .013). In addition, moderate increase of phenotypic variance is observed in the Tiwanaku period, probably because of an excess of gene flow coming from nearby regions.","2009-06","2021-04-06 01:24:12","2021-04-13 03:40:33","2021-04-06 01:24:12","333-342","","2","20","","Latin Am. antiq.","Microevolución En San Pedro De Atacama (Norte De Chile)","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","microevolución; San Pedro de Atacama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report the prevalence of lactose intolerance in a double-blind placebo study. METHODS: The LCT C\textgreaterT-13910 variant was genotyped by RT-PCR in 121 volunteers and lactose malabsorption was assessed using the hydrogen breath test (HBT) after consuming 25 g of lactose. Lactose intolerance was assessed by scoring symptoms (SS) using a standardized questionnaire following challenge with a lactose solution or saccharose placebo. RESULTS: The LNP genotype was observed in 57% of the volunteers, among whom 87% were HBT⁺. In the HBT⁺ group the median SS was 9 and in the HBT⁻ group the median SS was 3 (p \textless 0.001). No difference was observed in the SS when both groups were challenged with the placebo. The most common symptoms included audible bowel sounds, abdominal pain and meteorism. In the ROC curve analysis, an SS ≥ 6 demonstrated 72% sensitivity and 81% specificity for predicting a positive HBT. To estimate prevalence, lactose intolerance was defined as the presence of an SS ≥ 6 points after subtracting the placebo effect and 34% of the study population met this definition.

We used genome-wide data from 953 individuals from diverse African, European, and Native American populations to select AIMs optimized for each of the three main continental populations that form the basis of modern Latin American populations. We selected markers on the basis of locus-specific branch length to be informative, well distributed throughout the genome, capable of being genotyped on widely available commercial platforms, and applicable throughout the Americas by minimizing within-continent heterogeneity. We then validated the panel in samples from four admixed populations by comparing ancestry estimates based on the AIMs panel to estimates based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. The panel provided balanced discriminatory power among the three ancestral populations and accurate estimates of individual ancestry proportions (R² \textgreater 0.9 for ancestral components with significant between-subject variance).

Frisancho helped to move anthropology towards more mechanistic explanations of human adaptation by drawing attention to the importance of the functional relevance of human variation. Using the natural laboratory of high altitude, he and others asked whether the unique physiology of indigenous high-altitude residents was the result of acclimatization, developmental plasticity, and/or genetic adaptation in response to the high-altitude environment. We approach the question of human adaptation to high altitude from a somewhat unique vantage point; namely, by examining physiological characteristics-pregnancy and pregnancy outcome-which are closely associated with reproductive fitness. Here we review the potent example of high-altitude native population's resistance to hypoxia-associated reductions in birth weight, which is often associated with higher infant morbidity and mortality at high altitude. With the exception of two recent publications, these comparative birth weight studies have utilized surnames, self-identification, and/or linguistic characteristics to assess ancestry, and none have linked 'advantageous' phenotypes to specific genetic variations. Recent advancements in genetic and statistical tools have enabled us to assess individual ancestry with higher resolution, identify the genetic basis of complex phenotypes and to infer the effect of natural selection on specific gene regions. Using these technologies our studies are now directed to determine the genetic variations that underlie the mechanisms by which high-altitude ancestry protects fetal growth and, in turn, to further our understanding of evolutionary processes involved in human adaptation to high altitude.","2009","2021-04-07 00:09:02","2021-04-13 03:15:04","","614–622","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Genética,Población viva","","","","fertility; selection; altitude; genetic; acclimatization; anoxia; birth weight; fetal growth retardation; pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Latin America, the frequencies of this trait have been shown to vary according to the degree of admixture of the populations. The objective of this study is to better understand the relationship between this genetic trait and dairy intake in a multiethnic context through a synthesis of studies conducted in four regions of Chile. Methods Genotypes frequencies for the SNP LCT-13910C\textgreaterT (rs4988235) and frequency of dairy consumption were obtained from four populations: Polynesians from Easter Island (Rapanui); Amerindians (Mapuche) and Mestizos from the Araucanía region; urban Mestizos from Santiago; and rural Mestizos from the Coquimbo region. Genetic differentiation and association between milk consumption and genotype frequencies were estimated. Results Genetic differentiation between Native and Mestizo populations was significant; the LP frequency in Mapuche and Rapanui was 10% and 25%, respectively, whereas among the Mestizos, LP frequency was near 40%. Dairy intake was below the nutritional recommendations for the four groups, and extremely below recommendations among the indigenous populations. Association between milk intake and LP was found in Santiago and Rapanui populations. Conclusions Although the frequency of LP varies among the populations according to their degree of admixture, dairy consumption was very low across the populations. Given that the association between milk consumption and expected phenotype was found only in two of the populations analyzed, it seems that lactase non-persistence (LNP) is not the only cause for dairy avoidance.

However, Andean and Rocky Mountain high altitude natives have an intermediate level of ventilation lower than that of newcomers and Tibetan high altitude natives although generally higher than that of sea level natives at sea level. Because the reason for the relative hypoventilation of some high altitude native populations was unknown, a study was designed to describe ventilation from adolescence through old age in samples of Tibetan and Andean high altitude natives and to estimate the relative genetic and environmental influences. This paper compares resting ventilation and hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) of 320 Tibetans 9-82 years of age and 542 Bolivian Aymara 13-94 years of age, native residents at 3,800-4,065 m. Tibetan resting ventilation was roughly 1.5 times higher and Tibetan HVR was roughly double that of Aymara. Greater duration of hypoxia (older age) was not an important source of variation in resting ventilation or HVR in either sample. That is, contrary to previous studies, neither sample acquired hypoventilation in the age ranges under study. Within populations, greater severity of hypoxia (lower percent of oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin) was associated with slightly higher resting ventilation among Tibetans and lower resting ventilation and HVR among Aymara women, although the associations accounted for just 2-7% of the variation. Between populations, the Tibetan sample was more hypoxic and had higher resting ventilation and HVR. Other systematic environmental contrasts did not appear to elevate Tibetan or depress Aymara ventilation. There was more intrapopulation genetic variation in these traits in the Tibetan than the Aymara sample. Thirty-five percent of the Tibetan, but none of the Aymara, resting ventilation variance was due to genetic differences among individuals. Thirty-one percent of the Tibetan HVR, but just 21% of the Aymara, HVR variance was due to genetic differences among individuals. Thus there is greater potential for evolutionary change in these traits in the Tibetans. Presently, there are two different ventilation phenotypes among high altitude natives as compared with sea level populations at sea level: lifelong sustained high resting ventilation and a moderate HVR among Tibetans in contrast with a slightly elevated resting ventilation and a low HVR among Aymara.","1997-12","2021-04-07 01:10:28","2021-04-13 04:25:07","","427–447","","4","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Población viva","","","","microevolution; heritability; high altitude adaptation; quantitative genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both have been exposed to the opportunity for natural selection for traits that offset the unavoidable environmental stress of severe lifelong high-altitude hypoxia. This paper presents evidence that Tibetan and Andean high-altitude natives have adapted differently, as indicated by large quantitative differences in numerous physiological traits comprising the oxygen delivery process. These findings suggest the hypothesis that evolutionary processes have tinkered differently on the two founding populations and their descendents, with the result that the two followed different routes to the same functional outcome of successful oxygen delivery, long-term persistence and high function. Assessed on the basis of basal and maximal oxygen consumption, both populations avail themselves of essentially the full range of oxygen-using metabolism as populations at sea level, in contrast with the curtailed range available to visitors at high altitudes. Efforts to identify the genetic bases of these traits have included quantitative genetics, genetic admixture, and candidate gene approaches. These reveal generally more genetic variance in the Tibetan population and more potential for natural selection. There is evidence that natural selection is ongoing in the Tibetan population, where women estimated to have genotypes for high oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (and less physiological stress) have higher offspring survival. Identifying the genetic bases of these traits is crucial to discovering the steps along the Tibetan and Andean routes to functional adaptation.","2007-05","2021-04-06 23:58:49","2021-05-14 02:07:24","","8655–8660","","Suppl. 1","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Población viva","","","","natural selection; human; hypoxia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

O allele molecular characterization could aid in elucidating the possible causes of group O predominance in Native American populations. In this work, we studied exon 6 and 7 sequence diversity in 180 O blood group individuals from four different Mesoamerican populations. Additionally, a comparative analysis of genetic diversity and population structure including South American populations was performed. Results revealed no significant differences among Mesoamerican and South American groups, but showed significant differences within population groups attributable to previously detected differences in genetic drift and founder effects throughout the American continent. Interestingly, in all American populations, the same set of haplotypes O(1), O(1v), and O(1v(G542A)) was present, suggesting the following: (1) that they constitute the main genetic pool of the founding population of the Americas and (2) that they derive from the same ancestral source, partially supporting the single founding population hypothesis. In addition, the consistent and restricted presence of the G542A mutation in Native Americans compared to worldwide populations allows it to be employed as an Ancestry informative marker (AIM). Present knowledge of the peopling of the Americas allows the prediction of the way in which the G542A mutation could have emerged in Beringia, probably during the differentiation process of Asian lineages that gave rise to the founding population of the continent.","2010-05","2021-04-07 01:20:09","2021-04-11 19:09:52","","85–94","","1","142","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Centro,Norte Grande,Sur;Población viva,Genética","","","","genetic drift; populations; ABO; Americas peopling; blood groups; founder effect; Native American","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most human evolutionary genomic studies have been performed in European, African, and Asian populations. However, populations with Native American ancestry have been largely underrepresented. Here, we used a genome-wide local ancestry enrichment approach complemented with neutral simulations to identify postadmixture adaptations underwent by admixed Chileans through gene flow from Europeans into local Native Americans. The top significant hits (P = 2.4×10−7) are variants in a region on chromosome 12 comprising multiple regulatory elements. This region includes rs12821256, which regulates the expression of KITLG, a well-known gene involved in lighter hair and skin pigmentation in Europeans as well as in thermogenesis.

These changes have contributed in a gradual abandonment of traditional food production activities as well as rapid adoption of industrialized food in their diet. However, there are no studies that provide a diagnosis of these changes of the dietary patterns and their potential impact in the nutritional state of the aforementioned native communities in a context of considerable changes of local and worldwide diet and nutrition. Thus, the goals of this research are to identify the changes in the dietary patterns occurring during the last three generations of the Atacama communities of Toconao and Talabre, and to evaluate the changes of the nutritional state of the adult population at last decades of both communities. The data collection was done using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. In the first case, semi-structured interviews with the elderly of each community was performed in order to obtain an approximation to the dietary changes from a local and historical perspective. Additionally, free lists will be performed in people from three generations in order to visualize dietary preferences by generations. In the second case, antropometric measures of weight, height and body mass index was collected of the clinical records in the local heath center, including adults (between 18 to 90 years old) of the Toconao and Talabre communities. The results show drastic differences in food consumption between the three generations of both Atacama communities, with a loss in the consumption of traditional foods by the younger generations due to the substitution of local food for foreign food in the Atacama diet of Toconao and Talabre. From this research it is concluded that economic and political factors have contributed to this rapid change in subsistence systems and, consequently, in the diet and nutrition of these indigenous communities","2014","2021-04-14 18:24:01","2021-05-23 00:12:06","","","","","","","","Nutritional transition in indigenous communities of the Atacama Salt, Northern Chile: a biocultural approach of changes in Atacamenian diet and nutrition","","","","","Disertación presentada para la obtención del Título de Maestra en Ciencias en el Área de Ecología, Instituto de Biociencias de la Universidad de Sao Paulo","Sao Paulo, Brasil","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","Atacama salt; Atacameño traditional diet; Nutrition transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project evaluated the accuracy of the sex estimation discriminant function created from the tibia of a Mexican population, when applied to a Chilean population. The maximum distal epiphyseal breadth (MDEB) and the anterior-posterior diameter at the nutrient foramen (APDNF) were measured on 203 tibiae (108 males and 95 females) from the Subactual Skeletal Collection at the University of Chile. The individuals ranged in age from 20 to 96 years old. When the Mexican discriminant function was applied to the Chilean population, accuracy rates ranged from 76.0% (males) to 85.0% (females). Mean tibial size comparisons were made to a Mexican, Croatian, White South African, archaeological Hispanic, and North Indian population and showed some significant differences between the variables measured. Population-specific discriminant functions were created for the Chilean population with overall sex classification accuracy rates of 71.4% (MDEB only) to 89.2% (MDEB and APDNF).

However, at least for certain points of time in the cultural development, the overall cohesiveness of this ‘culture area’ has been called into question, favoring an alternative perspective that emphasizes the existence of several relatively independent nuclei of development on the North Coast, the southern Peruvian Highlands and the Titicaca basin, with distinct cultural expressions and political organization. Here, we engage archaeological evidence and its interpretation with newly emerging perspectives from linguistics and genetics (modern and ancient DNA), including new targeted genetic analysis, to add fresh evidence to the question of the internal structure and cohesiveness of the ancient Central Andes as a culture area. The double cultural/biological approach points at a North vs. South structure bisecting the Central Andes that becomes appreciable ~2,000 years ago; however, as the evidence from all three disciplines indicates, too, the spheres have remained connected and hence maintained an overall cohesiveness. Our analysis suggests that demographic population structure precedes the constitution of distinct cultural domains, a pattern which is to be verified in other chronological transects in South America and at a global scale.","2020-12-01","2021-04-16 02:15:11","2021-04-16 02:21:48","2021-04-16 02:15:11","101233","","","60","","Journal of Anthropological Archaeology","North and South in the ancient Central Andes","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Norte Grande;Genética","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\Y8IFNDP5\Urban and Barbieri - 2020 - North and South in the ancient Central Andes Cont.pdf","","","Archaeology; Population genetics; Population structure; Central Andes; Linguistics; State formation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, it is considered a key factor for the subsistence of prehistoric societies (including mixed-economy groups), that inhabited its coastal ecosystems as well as the neighboring inland areas. This study assesses the Arica Culture groups' diet (Late Intermediate Period; 1000–1530 CE), through stable isotope (on bone-collagen; δ13C and δ15N) and dental pathology data. Seventy-seven (n = 77) individuals from two inland (LLU54 and AZ8) and one coastal (CAM8) archaeological sites were studied. Results show an important, but lower than predicted by earlier studies, contribution of marine resources in the diet of all three groups. Dental pathologies and stable isotopes indicate that these groups' diet varied in correlation with their distance to the Pacific Ocean as well as group and individual preferences. The results challenge the idea that Arica Culture groups depended heavily on marine resources for their subsistence. In contrast, this study shows both that the Arica Culture groups’ diet was diverse, and that the terrestrial resources consumed were mostly contributed by C3/CAM plants instead of maize.","2019-06-15","2021-04-16 02:16:17","2021-08-10 04:12:37","2021-04-16 02:16:17","54-67","","","214","","Quaternary Science Reviews","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología,Isótopos","","","","stable isotopes; dental pathologies","Atacama desert; Late intermediate period","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, lead, strontium, zinc, and lithium concentrations were measured in dental tissue using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Teeth from two populations were sampled: ancient Chilean mummies (n=16) from Arica city as well as recently exfoliated deciduous teeth from contemporary Egyptian children (n=20) living in the Nile Delta. In this study, LA-ICP-MS was used to obtain high-resolution (50μm) elemental bioimages in dental tissue. The experiments consisted of fully quantitative Pb bioimages as well as semi-quantitative Zn and Li bioimages of one contemporary Nile Delta, Egypt tooth and one ancient tooth from the Andes. Lead levels in the Egyptian teeth averaged an order of magnitude greater than in the ancient Chilean teeth (14.93±32.28μg/g and 1.33±0.84μg/g, respectively), and had a much greater range of variation among teeth (1.02μg/g–68.38μg/g versus 0.36μg/g–2.35μg/g, respectively). Lithium, an element widely present in northern Chile, was found in higher concentrations in the Arica teeth than in the Kalama teeth, with the highest concentrations at two sites in Chilean burial grounds where water is tainted with natural lithium. Micrometer resolution images of quantified Pb, Zn, and Li concentrations from two teeth revealed higher concentrations of Pb and Zn in the pulp and surface enamel. Zn and Li are concentrated in the crown, potentially indicative of higher prenatal exposure.","2013-01-01","2021-04-16 02:16:31","2021-05-12 03:22:09","2021-04-16 02:16:31","340-346","","","106","","Microchemical Journal","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","lead; teeth; lithium; bioimaging","Chilean mummies; LA-ICP-MS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the fossil record of this island region has provided spectacular findings of different platyrrhines that were part of a diverse radiation showing exceptionally unusual morphologies. Among these, the Cuban genus Paralouatta represents some of the most enigmatic primates ever discovered in the Greater Antilles. Some researchers have argued that Paralouatta’s post-cranium shows evidence of semi-terrestriality, a locomotor adaptation that is unusual, if not unique, in platyrrhine evolutionary history. Whether or not Paralouatta was truly semi-terrestrial remains uncertain, however, due to a lack of more sophisticated functional analyses on its morphology. Using novel virtual morpho-functional tools on a comparative sample of 3D talar models of diverse anthropoids representing different substrate preferences, this study aims to further assess whether Paralouatta corresponds to a semi-terrestrial species or not. Specifically, finite-element analysis and geometric morphometrics were used to empirically assess biomechanical performance and shape, respectively, and then several machine-learning (ML) algorithms were trained using both the biomechanical and morphometric data to clarify the substrate preference of the fossil specimens. The ML algorithms categorized the Paralouatta fossils as either arboreal or as species commonly active on both ground and in trees. These mixed results are suggestive of some level of semi-terrestriality, thus representing the only known example of this locomotor behavior in platyrrhine evolutionary history.","2020","2021-04-18 16:08:02","2021-08-06 18:54:08","2021-04-18 16:08:02","","","","8","","Front.

We expected the stress to be better distributed in our species than in other hominids based on the idea that, unlike apes, the human hand is adapted to tool-related behaviors. Our results indicate that the human phalanx unevenly distributes stresses and is one of the most fragile of all, especially when a small hammerstone is simulated.

As a case study, several armadillo mandibles are analysed, showing that the proposed method is useful to distinguish and characterise biomechanical differences related to diet/ecomorphology. Methods The intervals’ method consists of generating a set of variables, each one defined by an interval of stress values. Each variable is expressed as a percentage of the area of the mandible occupied by those stress values. Afterwards these newly generated variables can be analysed using multivariate methods. Results Applying this novel method to the biological case study of whether armadillo mandibles differ according to dietary groups, we show that the intervals’ method is a powerful tool to characterize biomechanical performance and how this relates to different diets. This allows us to positively discriminate between specialist and generalist species. Discussion We show that the proposed approach is a useful methodology not affected by the characteristics of the finite element mesh. Additionally, the positive discriminating results obtained when analysing a difficult case study suggest that the proposed method could be a very useful tool for comparative studies in finite element analysis using multivariate statistical approaches.","2017-10-13","2021-04-18 16:15:05","2021-05-16 15:00:46","2021-04-18 16:15:05","e3793","","","5","","PeerJ","The intervals method","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","Fuera de Chile;Morfometría","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\JP7CIP4U\Marcé-Nogué et al. - 2017 - The intervals method a new approach to analyse fi.pdf","","multivariate statistics; finite element outputs; intervals method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Talar morphology can provide information about postural adaptations because it is the anatomical structure responsible for transmitting body mass forces from the leg to the foot. The aim of this study is to test whether the locomotor behaviour of fossil Miocene platyrrhines could be inferred from their talus morphology. The extant sample was classified into three different locomotor categories and then talar strength was compared using finite-element analysis. Geometric morphometrics were used to quantify talar shape and to assess its association with biomechanical strength. Finally, several machine-learning (ML) algorithms were trained using both the biomechanical and morphometric data from the extant taxa to infer the possible locomotor behaviour of the Miocene fossil sample. The obtained results show that the different locomotor categories are distinguishable using either biomechanical or morphometric data. The ML algorithms categorized most of the fossil sample as arboreal quadrupeds. This study has shown that a combined approach can contribute to the understanding of platyrrhine talar morphology and its relationship with locomotion. This approach is likely to be beneficial for determining the locomotor habits in other fossil taxa.","2018-09","2021-04-18 16:15:40","2021-05-16 15:00:26","2021-04-18 16:15:40","20180520","","146","15","","J.

An African great-ape-like ancestor using knuckle-walking is still the most parsimonious hypothesis for the LCA, despite diverse conflicting lines of evidence. Crucial to this hypothesis is the role of the centrale in the hominoid wrist, since the fusion of this bone with the scaphoid is among the clearest morphological synapomorphies of African apes and hominins. However, the exact functional significance of this fusion remains unclear. We address this question by carrying out finite element simulations of the hominoid wrist during knuckle-walking by virtually generating fused and unfused morphologies in a sample of hominoids. Finite element analysis was applied to test the hypothesis that a fused scaphoid-centrale better withstands the loads derived from knuckle-walking. The results show that fused morphologies display lower stress values, hence supporting a biomechanical explanation for the fusion as a functional adaptation for knuckle-walking. This functional interpretation for the fusion contrasts with the current inferred positional behaviour of the earliest hominins, thus suggesting that this morphology was probably retained from an LCA that exhibited knuckle-walking as part of its locomotor repertoire and that was probably later exapted for other functions.","2020-02-26","2021-04-18 16:16:17","2021-05-16 15:00:22","2021-04-18 16:16:17","3526","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Fuera de Chile;Paleoantropología,Morfometría","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\JHZKD3ZH\Püschel et al. - 2020 - The biomechanical importance of the scaphoid-centr.pdf","","scaphoid-centrale; knuckle-walking; human locomotor evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work presents an extensive comparative sample of 30 extant primate species that was assembled to perform a morpho-functional comparison of these taxa with 12 models corresponding to eight fossil hominin species. Finite Element Analysis and Geometric Morphometrics were employed to analyse chewing biomechanics and mandible morphology to, firstly, establish the variation of this clade, secondly, relate stress and shape variables, and finally, to classify fossil individuals into broad ingesta related hardness categories using a support vector machine algorithm. Our results suggest that some hominins previously assigned as hard food consumers (e.g. the members of the Paranthropus clade) in fact seem to rely more strongly on soft foods, which is consistent with most recent studies using either microwear or stable isotope analyses. By analysing morphometric and stress results in the context of the comparative framework, we conclude that in the hominin clade there were probably no hard-food specialists. Nonetheless, the biomechanical ability to comminute harder items, if required as fallback option, adds to their strategy of increased flexibility.","2020-04-22","2021-04-18 16:16:24","2021-05-16 15:00:12","2021-04-18 16:16:24","6793","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Fuera de Chile;Paleoantropología,Morfometría","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\65TGH7ZP\Marcé-Nogué et al. - 2020 - Broad-scale morpho-functional traits of the mandib.pdf","","hominin; morpho-functional; mandible","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about whether the variation in these various anatomical differences is linked and to what extent the wrist bones vary independently. Here, we used 3D geometric morphometrics on a sample of extant hominids (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Gorilla beringei), to find the model that best describes the covariation patterns among four of the eight carpals (i.e., capitate, lunate, scaphoid, and trapezium). For this purpose, 15 modular hypotheses were tested using the Covariation Coefficient. Results indicate that there is a covariation structure common to all hominids, which corresponds to stronger covariation within each carpal as compared to the covariation between carpals. However, the results also indicate that that there is a degree of codependence in the variation of some carpals, which is unique in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, respectively. In humans there is evidence of associated shape changes between the lunate and capitate, and between the scaphoid and trapezium. This covariation between lunate and capitate is also apparent in gorillas, while chimpanzees display the greatest disassociation among carpals, showing low covariation values in all pairwise comparisons. Our analyses indicate that carpals have an important level of variational independence which might suggest a high degree of independent evolvability in the wrists of hominids, and that although weak, the structure of associated changes of these four carpals varies across genera.

Due to the demographic shifts that occurred after European contact, the origin(s) of these ancient populations, and their genetic relationship to present-day islanders, are unclear. We use ancient DNA to characterize the population history and genetic legacies of precontact Indigenous communities from Puerto Rico. Bone, tooth, and dental calculus samples were collected from 124 individuals from three precontact archaeological sites: Tibes, Punta Candelero, and Paso del Indio. Despite poor DNA preservation, we used target enrichment and high-throughput sequencing to obtain complete mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) from 45 individuals and autosomal genotypes from two individuals. We found a high proportion of Native American mtDNA haplogroups A2 and C1 in the precontact Puerto Rico sample (40% and 44%, respectively). This distribution, as well as the haplotypes represented, supports a primarily Amazonian South American origin for these populations and mirrors the Native American mtDNA diversity patterns found in present-day islanders. Three mtDNA haplotypes from precontact Puerto Rico persist among Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean islanders, indicating that present-day populations are reservoirs of precontact mtDNA diversity. Lastly, we find similarity in autosomal ancestry patterns between precontact individuals from Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, suggesting a shared component of Indigenous Caribbean ancestry with close affinity to South American populations. Our findings contribute to a more complete reconstruction of precontact Caribbean population history and explore the role of Indigenous peoples in shaping the biocultural diversity of present-day Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean islanders.","2020-03-01","2021-04-27 23:11:39","2021-08-10 16:14:58","2021-04-27 23:11:39","611-626","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Fuera de Chile;Genética","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\FLHHIBCE\Nieves-Colón et al. - 2020 - Ancient DNA Reconstructs the Genetic Legacies of P.pdf","","ancient DNA; Puerto Rico; Precontact","","Mulligan, Connie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One approach to establish the identity of unidentified biological material is to predict the face from DNA, and subsequently to match against facial images. However, DNA phenotyping of the human face remains challenging. Here, another proof of concept to biometric authentication is established by using multiple face-to-DNA classifiers, each classifying given faces by a DNA-encoded aspect (sex, genomic background, individual genetic loci), or by a DNA-inferred aspect (BMI, age). Face-to-DNA classifiers on distinct DNA aspects are fused into one matching score for any given face against DNA. In a globally diverse, and subsequently in a homogeneous cohort, we demonstrate preliminary, but substantial true (83%, 80%) over false (17%, 20%) matching in verification mode. Consequences of future efforts include forensic applications, necessitating careful consideration of ethical and legal implications for privacy in genomic databases","2019-12","2021-04-29 01:13:46","2021-04-29 01:24:10","2021-04-29 01:13:45","2557","","1","10","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Fuera de Chile;Genética","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\YUJSFCMX\Sero et al. - 2019 - Facial recognition from DNA using face-to-DNA clas.pdf","","facial recognition; face-to-DNA classifiers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estas condiciones ambientales promovieron el desarrollo de adaptaciones biológicas, detectables a nivel genómico. Usando datos de genotipificación (700.000 SNPs), estudiamos elementos de la historia microevolutiva de los Aymara, Pehuenche y Huilliche; grupos de ancestría amerindia que descienden de pueblos prehispánicos del altiplano andino y del centro-sur de Chile. Al analizar su estructura poblacional con el test Fst, encontramos una baja diferenciación entre los grupos. Usando ADMIXTURE, no detectamos estructura genética entre Pehuenches y Huilliches. Con los test iHS y XPEHH, identificamos regiones genómicas con señales de selección positiva reciente (<30.000 años) en Amerindios, no presentes en asiáticos, europeos, ni africanos. Destacamos una región del cromosoma 6 (52-52,6 Mb), con alta evidencia de selección en los tres grupos. Las regiones más diferenciadas entre Aymaras y el grupo de Pehuenches y Huilliches (5% de los puntajes más altos de Fst y XPEHH) contienen genes asociados al metabolismo de lípidos y al sistema inmune.

En este trabajo, se cuantifica el estrés de individuos viviendo en diferentes comunas, y se lo discute como causa y consecuencia de procesos vinculados con inequidades en salud. El objetivo era relacionar el Índice de Calidad de Vida Urbana (ICVU) de la comuna de residencia de individuos en Santiago de Chile con las concentra¬ciones de cortisol en pelo (CCP), un biomarcador de los niveles de estrés fisiológico crónico.  Materiales y Métodos: Se exploró la relación entre CCP y la edad, el sexo y el ICVU de la co¬muna de residencia en 80 estudiantes de educación superior en Santiago de Chile.  Resultados: No se encontraron correlaciones significativas entre CCP y la edad o el sexo de los participantes. Se encontró una correlación significativa entre CCP y los valores del ICVU de la comuna de residencia, además de encontrar diferencias significativas entre CCP y los distintos rangos de ICVU (Superior, Promedio e Inferior).  Discusión: Los resultados sugieren considerar las diferencias individuales de CCP como re¬sultado de desigualdades socio-territoriales y también como posible causa de inequidades en salud.

En América del Sur, investigaciones de este tipo han puesto su particular atención en la zona andina por poseer una diversidad genética que la diferencia del resto del continente. Dentro de este contexto, la segunda región de Chile se constituye como un área de estudio, puesto que evidencias arqueológicas avalan su relación con otras poblaciones de los Andes Centro Sur durante tiempos prehispánicos como históricos, y donde los distintos procesos migratorios han enriquecido su historia local en los siglos más recientes. Considerando que lo obtenido a partir del cromosoma Y nos permite profundizar en las dinámicas poblacionales desde una mirada patrilineal, la presente memoria tuvo como objetivo caracterizar la composición de linajes paternos en las ciudades de Antofagasta y Calama y compararlas con otras poblaciones chilenas y del círculo andino. A través del análisis de 232 muestras de saliva, se evidenció una predominancia de haplogrupos foráneos por sobre los nativos, siendo mayor en las poblaciones de Antofagasta y la costa, mientras que en Calama y las localidades aledañas se observó una contribución amerindia más alta. Los poblados cordilleranos aledaños a Calama presentaron diferencias significativas con el resto de las poblaciones urbanas de Chile y frecuencias similares a otras poblaciones de los Andes Centro Sur. Además, fue encontrado un portador del sublinaje amerindio Q1b1a1a1d-SA01 que se ha asociado con poblaciones del altiplano andino. Los resultados de esta investigación responden a patrones migratorios específicos en la formación de las distintas ciudades, reportados desde la historiografía local y constituyen una primera aproximación a la caracterización genética de la región de Antofagasta para la reconstrucción de la historia paterna de sus poblaciones","2019","2021-05-11 13:55:06","2021-08-10 16:25:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","Memoria para optar al título de Antropóloga Física, Universidad de Chile","Santiago, Chile","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Genética","","","","Andes Centro Sur; SNPs; cromosoma Y; región de Antofagasta; subhaplogrupos amerindios","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such studies are strengthened greatly through the application of statistical models that permit precise and model-bound estimates of weaning age, duration, trophic enrichment, and the isotopic characterization of supplementary foods. Here we present the result of a stable isotope (N-15) and Bayesian computational modeling study of bone collagen from human subadults from two coastal cemetery sites located near the mouth of the River Loa in the Atacama Desert. Recent bioarchaeological and paleodemographic research on remains from these marine hunter-gatherer sites, which are contemporary with the Formative Period (1500 BC-AD 400), has found evidence for notably elevated rates of female fertility. Ultimately, we argue that the modeled BWP parameters, which indicate the early introduction of supplementary foods, support an argument of high fertility as gleaned from the bioarchaeological evidence, and that these results provide novel insights into the child-rearing practices of the coastal populations of the Atacama. Indeed, these populations would have seemed to have developed a set of BWP that carefully balanced the biological and economic production/reproduction of the community.","2017-10-02","2021-05-20 04:50:22","2021-05-20 04:52:50","2021-05-20 04:50:22","558-571","","4","12","","The Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología,Isótopos","","","","bone; archaeometry; economy and subsistence; mortuary remains; Southern Andes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aims/objectives: Determining prevalence of otitis media and diagnostic usefulness of temporal-bone X-rays in skulls. Materials and methods: 444 skulls belonging to three groups: prehistoric-coastal (400–1000 AD), prehistoric-highland (400–1000 AD) and Pisagua-Regional Developments (1000–1450 AD). Skulls were evaluated visually and with Schuller’s view X-rays. Five skulls diagnosed as having had otitis media, five diagnosed as normal, and one with temporal bone fistula also had a computed tomography (CT). Results: Changes suggestive of otitis media were present in Prehistoric-coastal 53.57%; Pisagua-Regional Developments 70.73%; prehistoric-highlands 47.90%. Diagnostic effectiveness of Schuller’s view X-rays for assesing middle ear disease was confirmed by CT studies. The case with temporal bone fistula had changes suggestive of mastoiditis and possible post auricular abscess. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of otitis media in prehistoric populations in Chile. The higher prevalence in one group was presumably due to racial factors. Temporal-bone X-rays are effective for massive evaluation of ear disease in skulls. A case of mastoiditis with temporal bone fistula and possible post-auricular abscess is documented. Significance: Documenting racial factors in otitis media. Validating X-rays for massive evaluation of otitis media in skulls.","2019","2021-06-08 02:24:03","2021-06-08 02:40:52","","340-344","","4","139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","paleopathology; 3D face reconstruction; 3D skull reconstruction; image segmentation; mastoid abscess; racial factors in otitis media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advent of agriculture and animal domestication, with its accompanying reduction in human mobility and expanding population involves changes in or emergence of, parasites, the so-called first epidemiological transition. Cultural processes related to territory occupation contribute to both loss and acquisition of parasites. The archaeological site Lluta 57 in the Lluta Valley, Chile, provides a chronology of the transition from the pre-Inca or Late Intermediate Period (LIP), through the Late or Inca Period (LP), to the Hispanic Contact Period (HCP), providing the possibility of evaluating this epidemiological transition. The aim of this study was to conduct a paleoparasitological investigation of to gain insight into the dynamics of parasitism in Lluta people throughout the Inca expansion. Fourteen human coprolites from the three periods were rehydrated, submitted to spontaneous sedimentation, and examined by light microscopy for the presence of intestinal parasite eggs, pollen grains, and micro-remains. Eggs of four parasites: Enterobius vermicularis, Trichostrongylus sp., Trichuris sp., and Eimeria macusaniensis were recovered. Frequency, diversity, and number of parasite eggs per sample increased over the studied time period. Trichostrongylus sp. and E. macusaniensis were recorded in the region for the first time. Enterobius vermicularis eggs, absent in the LIP, were present as a hyper-infection in LP. The presence of E. macusaniensis is likely related to exploitation of llamas, which were used for food and transport and as sacrificial offerings. The paleobotanical analysis revealed ten families of pollen grains, as well as phytoliths and floral remains. In contrast to parasitological results, a diachronic pattern was not detected. Evolution of the settlements, with the advent of larger, more densely populated, villages, could have influenced the emergence and intensification of transmission of parasites in the region. The study showed that the Inca expansion influenced host-parasite-environment relationships in the Lluta Valley.","2018","2021-06-08 02:24:03","2021-06-08 02:42:16","","290–296","","","178","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","Inca empire; coprolite; helminth; micro-remains; paleobotany; paleoparasitology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, southern coastal groups exposed to colder ocean water have a lesser incidence of exostosis, possibly due to less duration of exposure. There was a high incidence of otitis media in all groups of native population in Chile. One coastal group had a higher incidence, presumably due to racial factors. Background: This is a paleopathological and paleoepidemiological study in temporal bones which assesses external ear canal exostosis and otitis media in prehistoric and historic native populations in Chile. Materials and methods: A total of 460 temporal bones were evaluated for exostosis (ex) and 542 temporal bones were evaluated for otitis media (om). The study involved four groups: (1) Prehistoric Coastal (400–1000 AD) populations in Northern Chile (Pisagua-Tiwanaku) (22 temporal bones ex; 28 om); (2) Prehistoric Highland (400–1000 AD) populations in Northern Chile (292 temporal bones ex; 334 om); (3) Pisagua-Regional Developments (coastal) in Northern Chile (1000–1450 AD) (66 temporal bones ex; 82 om); and (4) Historic (1500–1800 AD) coastal populations in Southern Chile (80 temporal bones ex: 18 Chonos, 62 Fuegians. 98 om: 22 Chonos, 76 Fuegians). Skulls were evaluated visually and with an operating microscope. In addition, the otitis media group was evaluated with Temporal bone radiology–-lateral XRays-Schuller view–to assess pneumatization as evidence of previous middle ear disease. Results: Prehistoric northern coastal groups had an incidence of exostosis of 15.91%, the northern highlands group 1.37%, and the southern coastal group 1.25%. There were changes suggestive of otitis media in: Pisagua/Tiwanaku 53.57%; Pisagua/Regional Developments 70.73%; Northern Highlands population 47.90%; Chonos 63.64%; and Fuegian tribes 64.47%.","2017","2021-06-08 02:24:03","2021-06-08 03:38:59","","365-369","","4","137","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","otitis media; otitis media racial factors; pronicity factors; exostosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sulfur isotopes were useful to decipher some cases where carbon and nitrogen did not detect significant consumption of terrestrial resources. These isotopic results confirm that the exploitation of marine resources was the main activity for the inhabitants of the Formative Period, a time of neolithization process in south central Andes. This contradicts previous assumptions on the speed of the shift from the exploitation of marine to terrestrial resources, suggesting that this transition did not impact the subsistence strategies of this population as fast as previously thought. Therefore the ""neolithization"" of populations during this period did not lead to a significant change in diet. In this paper we present data from fifteen individuals, of which thirteen had a diet mainly based on marine resources, while two showed a more terrestrial-based diet. These different cases among individuals in relation to different access to resources are discussed. Moreover, the results are compared with those obtained from other contemporaneous Chilean sites of the same geographical area. This investigation on mummified hair samples offers new palaeodiet insights into the prehistoric subsistence strategies in northern Chile during a key transitional period.","2016","2021-06-08 02:24:04","2021-06-08 02:32:15","","768–776","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología,Isótopos","","","","Formative period; stable isotope analysis; hair; palaeodiet; carbon; nitrogen; sulfur","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Se analizan las modificaciones tafonómicas pre y posdepo- sitacionales y los procesos fisiológicos y patológicos que afectaron los nueve individuos identificados en el sitio (seis que componen el entierro y tres hallados por fuera de la estructura), actualmente depositados en la División de Antropología del Museo Americano de Historia Natural de Nueva york. Del análisis de las variables antrópicas se desprende que las evidencias de alteración térmica intencional en los esquele- tos no alcanzarían para definir a este entierro como cremación, considerando más adecuado interpretar los rastros de la acción del fuego como combustión parcial del entierro. El panorama que involucra la muerte de siete individos (seis procedentes del entierro aquí analizados y uno extraviado) a comienzos del Holoceno tardío en Pali Aike meridional (ca. 3.600 años AP.), se relacionaría con el incremento de la mortalidad derivada de la mayor densidad poblacional del área inferida para momentos posteriores al 4.000 AP., aunque las causas precisas de los decesos simultáneos siguen sin conocerse.","2010","2021-08-11 23:57:43","2021-08-13 04:29:24","","133-149","","2","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Extremo Sur;Bioarqueología","","C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\JM7CAB75\LHeureux and Amorosi - 2010 - EL ENTIERRO DEL SITIO CERRO SOTA (MAGALLANES, CHIL.pdf; C:\Users\yo\Zotero\storage\LSHK5WXP\LHeureux and Amorosi - 2010 - EL ENTIERRO DEL SITIO CERRO SOTA (MAGALLANES, CHIL.pdf","","combustión parcial; comienzos Holoceno tardío; entierro múltiple; Magallanes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence indicates that 4,000 years ago in northern Chile cases displaying digestive symptoms or 'megacolon' were frequent. Recent information on the dispersion of the domestic insect vector Triatoma infestans allows us to conclude that in the past only the wild Mepraia gajardoi insect vector transmitted Trypanosoma cruzi in its native area. This information together with current knowledge about Trypanosoma cruzi circulating in the area and transmitted by Mepraia gajardoi will be important to establish possible host-parasite association with Chagas disease pathology.","2011","2021-08-11 23:57:39","2021-08-13 03:56:23","","315-322","","2","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","Chagas; T.

Estos cuerpos pertenecen a la fase cultural conocida localmente como “Alto Ramírez” y sucede a la población Chinchorro, antiguos habitantes en la costa del norte de Chile, a partir de aproximadamente los 1000 a.C. hasta 500 d.C. Resultados radiocarbónicos ubican a esta muestra entre 350 a.C. a 500 d.C. Rasgos anatómicos micro y macroscópicos encontrados en los ocho cuerpos indican la evidencia de neumonía lobular que pudo complicar la salud de estos individuos o causarles la muerte. Polvo en suspensión en el aire por efecto del trabajo agrícola y la condición natural del aire en esta zona desértica con alto contenido de partículas en suspensión contribuyeron al desarrollo de la neumoconiosis silicosa. La reconstrucción de la dieta reveló que, en contraste a sus predecesores costeros (Chinchorros), la gente de Alto Ramírez dependía sustancialmente de estrategias de subsistencia agro- pastoriles. Sin embargo, la explotación de los abundantes y permanentes recursos marítimos constituyeron un tercio de su dieta. La ausencia de infección intestinal por lombrices transmitida a través del consumo de carne de pescado crudo, comúnmente encontrado entre los Chinchorros, sugiere que el pescado se comía cocinado. Si esta muestra caracteriza a la población en su totalidad, el desarrollo de la economía agropastoril en el área costera se caracteriza por un alta incidencia de infecciones pulmonares. Un estudio más amplio de esta población y su precedente Chinchorro, se requiere para evaluar esta observación.","2002","2021-08-11 23:57:42","2021-08-13 04:05:16","","253-263","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","paleopathology; mummies; Alto Ramirez; diet; Pneumonia; silicate pneumoconiosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most common means of assessing biological differences is through comparing craniofacial metrics. Craniofacial growth is under genetic control but strongly influenced by environmental factors, including artificial cranial modification (ACM). Some scholars believe ACM affects craniofacial metrics, but other scholars disagree. This study seeks to remedy this debate. A total of 218 adult crania (101 unmodified, 117 modified) from coastal and inland sites of three northern Chilean valleys were surveyed and examined for craniofacial metric changes through the use of modern orthodontic cephalometric analyses. Unmodified crania were statistically tested with the hierarchical linear analysis test to determine if there were any differences based on site, region (coast vs. inland), period, or sex within the unmodified sample, followed by a comparison of these data to modified cranial data. Statistical tests, specifically the ANOVA test, of the data determined that ACM affected some but not all craniofacial measurements utilized in this study. This conclusion, coupled with the varying conclusions of similar previously conducted studies, suggests that scholars must be cautious in employing modified crania and craniofacial metrics in any study of biological affinities.","2015","2021-08-11 23:57:42","2021-08-13 03:26:59","","331-341","","2","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Norte Grande;Bioarqueología","","","","Andes; cephalometry; artificial cranial modification; craniofacial metrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
